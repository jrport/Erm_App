# README

E.R.M. application built using ruby on rails.
It's functionalities are to be: 
- Registering inventories itens, incoming requests from various units and acquisitions.
- Tracking changes and allowing for updates of such registries.
- (Maybe?) Some form of authentication to allow for units to register their requests themselves. (Admin and user privileges?)
- Intuitive graphical displays and search capacities of the registred data.
